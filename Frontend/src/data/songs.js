      In the heart of the woods where the rivers flow,  
      We dance in circles where the moonlight glows.  
      Drums beat steady, voices rise high,  
      Calling the spirits of the earth and sky.

      Gather the grain, under sunâ€™s warm smile,  
      Feet in the soil, we sing all the while.  
      The seeds we sow, the gifts we reap,  
      Songs of the harvest, memories to keep.

      Thunder speaks and the trees sway wide,  
      Feet pound earth in rhythmic stride.  
      Rain we call, to bless the land,  
      In sacred dance, hand in hand.
